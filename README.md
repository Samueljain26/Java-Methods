# Java-Methods
1. Introduction to Methods
Methods help break a program into smaller, manageable parts.
They improve code organization, reusability, and readability.
A method takes input (parameters), performs a task, and may return a result.

2. Components of a Method
Method Name → Represents the action performed (e.g., greet).
Parentheses () → May include parameters (input values).
Method Body {} → Contains the instructions to execute.
Return Type → Specifies whether the method returns a value or not (void means no return value).

3. Calling a Method
A method must be called (invoked) to execute.
Methods inside a class are accessed using an object of that class.

4. Using Methods Multiple Times
Methods can be called multiple times in different parts of the program.
This avoids writing duplicate code and promotes code reuse.

5. Making Methods Dynamic
Parameters (Arguments) → Allow methods to receive input and work dynamically.
Return Statement → Returns a computed result back to the caller.

6. Types of Methods
User-Defined Methods → Created by the programmer.
Recursive Methods → Methods that call themselves to solve problems like factorial calculation.
Static Methods → Belong to a class and can be called without creating an object.

7. Java Standard Library Methods
Math Methods → Useful for calculations (sqrt(), pow(), random()).
Utility Classes → Scanner (for input), ArrayList, HashMap, etc.

8. Best Programming Practices
Use meaningful method names that describe their functionality.
Follow proper naming conventions for variables, methods, and classes.
Write modular code by dividing logic into separate methods.
Avoid hardcoding values; use parameters instead.
Validate inputs before processing to prevent errors.
